   For this blog, Mr Ampah-Korsa have asked the people with working blogs to write a blog post on what we think that we should improve in our blog. First of all I will tell you the different features of my blog at this current moment so then you can see the improvements in which I have made since now. My background is Tatooine in space (a Star Wars planet), my description and name is orange, my blog and about in the top right-hand corner is a light green, my main writing which you're reading now is yellow, where it says my title and 'read moreâ€™, they are both a light-blue. Next I have semi-transparent red boxes around my main writing which have a 40% opacity and curved corners for each box.

   My improvements are maybe to improve my red box colour as the further away you go, yellow doesn't contrast that well with the lightish-red. Also each of my titles in my blog could be a different colour to the main writing just to make it stand out as - right now - the only way that you can see my titles more clearly is the space between my paragraphs & the titles and that the are in separate boxes.
