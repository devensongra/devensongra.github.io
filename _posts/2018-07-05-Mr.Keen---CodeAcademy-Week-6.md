    <td>In this lesson I was working very hard and I managed to complete 3 stages of codeacademy again meaning that I was working very quickly and sufficient. The effective strategies was to not actually talk to somebody and go off topic about it and I would be able to help them if they needed help and I would just go back to my own work once I'm finished with helping them.

  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I will improve my learning by helping other students more as they ask me for help however I put myself first before them which is a very selfish thing to do (in my opinion) and also I can - as I said earlier - just practise working more consistent in my work and work at the same pace over and over again, that way I can just progress quicker I think.</td>
