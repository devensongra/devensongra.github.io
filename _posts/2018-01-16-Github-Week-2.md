    <td>Today in our I.T lesson, We were looking at how to work out fuse boxes by using all of the right plugs and cables in the fuse box. Our teacher  showed us how to connect, the usb cable, the fuse and the pen drive (usb stick). He then showed us how to turn the fuse box on and connect it to the computer and use it as the monitor. The effective strategie were to listen and watch him carefully as he assembled the fuse box. In that way we managed to connect everything correctly.</td>
