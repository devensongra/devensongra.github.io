    <td>In this lesson we got about 40 minutes of productive work on our Code Academy in python. We missed last week due to Bank holiday and the inset day. This lesson had a lot of productive work and I feel that i had worked as hard as possible as I could have today and the best that I have worked overall. I managed to complete 6 stages this lesson. I found not talking to other people was fast as I ended up completing a lot more than a whole section within an hour where as if I were to be talking with a friend I would complete one section.</td>
