    <td>In today's lesson we overcame a difficulty towards the fact our fuzebox was not working it had the massive heading of "No Signal" we soon realised it wasn't the monitor but the fuzebox this stopped us from doing our work for a few minutes but we soon then got back on track so our effective strategy was to carry on and not stop and try to find the root problem before giving up this made our work way easier and efficient therefore we did very well.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My Learning was very limited by my penn drive as well as my partner's penn drive was not working this really limited my learning whilst at the same time we had to change fuse boxes as that was also limiting my learning but when we did get onto the code we did get ahead as we are a very good team and manage to work really fast and swiftly.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I am just going to carry on with the work I started this lesson as it is all saved to my Penn drive. Also maybe I could work a bit quicker and as I know how to assemble the fuse box, then I can not get stuck with anything and get straight to the work. Also when we were looking at our blogs and mine was shown, he said it was good content and colour, it's just that I need to maybe choose a more appropriate background as right now it is a banana as a cheerleader, which really is kind of for younger people than our age as I am in year 8 so maybe I need to show that I'm more serious about the blog.</td>
