    <td>In today's lesson my partner, Liam and I set up our fuze box straight away and got on with the work. We had 1 and a half sections left to get onto the "flashing lights section" which uses the electrical component kit which was a very hard segment and can be very confusing and if one thing is wrong the whole thing is, so we worked very hard and then managed to get onto the flashing lights section. The strategies that were effective in the lesson were lots of teamwork, as we needed to make sure that we were working together so that we didn't get anything wrong. Also perseverance was extremely important, as we had a lot to do in little time. However we worked hard and Finished the Flashing Lights.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Today, the one crucial thing which limited my learning was the time we had for this task. We had to stop at 12:15 again so we only got to code for about 35 minutes as Mr Ampah-Korsah we talking to us and at the end of the lesson we had to show Mr Ampah-Korsah our blogs. I think that the thing that I need to work on is maybe to try and be more concentrated on the work as we lost track of time and LIam at one point got to code for 15 minutes.We switched every few minutes which was good and gave one person to rest their fingers and be prepared to type more code as it was easier to work.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I would just change a few things as for example I would quickly do this and not waste a single bit of time and therefore we can move on but really We couldn't move on because you need about 20 minutes to gather things together for the next segment which is robots. </td>
