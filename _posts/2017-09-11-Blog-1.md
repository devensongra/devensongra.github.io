    <td><div>The things I learnt were how to delete my repository and make a new one using a website called Github. Github is a website where you can make your own blog using only a few simple steps. I had a blog previously, but as I am starting a new year of school, I am deleting my old blog and creating a new one. In my blog, I will tell you about each of the things I do in my IT lessons in school weekly as that's how often we have our lesson. The effective strategies that I used were to work quickly  and sufficiently to get on with the work. Also an effective strategy was using our iPads to follow the instructions on, while we did it on the computer, so we didn’t have to keep flicking tabs on the computer.</div></td>

  <tr>
    <td><div>The thing which limited my learning was the time we had to do the work. I had to finish it off at home as I didn’t get enough time in school, during the lesson. The habits I need to work on are that I shouldn’t spend too much time trying to figure out what I should do with my work as I took quite long to decide what to actually call my new blog as most names were already taken.</div></td>

    <td><div>Next time I will try to maybe work quicker to do the work and not leave it to do at home. I could improve my learning by experimenting with the types of backgrounds and features of my blog so it shows that I have put a lot of effort into the given work.</div></td>
