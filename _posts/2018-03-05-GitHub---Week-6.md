    <td>In this lesson we overcame no difficulties as we swiftly did 2 exercises (Light Up and Round up) Round up was fairly easy compared to many of the other exercises that we completed in the past therefore we could easily move on into the harder things as the next exercise involved using wires.Our effective strategy is being swift and fast at everything so everything can get done and we dont have to worry about being behind.</td>

    <td>For next time I'll take control more timekeeping for the pair as at the end of the lesson, I wasn't keeping track of time and Liam got his and almost all of my slot for the coding part of things. We did agree though for the next time though, I will get a longer go at the coding just to make it more fair as a lot of people, were not switching when they were meant to.
