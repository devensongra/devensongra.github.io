    <td>Today in our I.T lesson, We were looking again at how to work out fuse boxes by using all of the right plugs and cables in the fuse box. Then we actually used them, by one person reading out the manual and the other one doing the coding. We were ahead of many other people because our effective strategy was to quickly and swiftly get the code done. We faced a small difficulty with our Computer monitor but we quickly moved on to a different computer so we can move on, Nothing went wrong. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Our computer monitor limited our lesson time as it took us a bit of time to realise our fuzebox and monitor isn't working so we were wasting a lot of time but because me and my partner had good teamwork we easily moved over this problem by moving to another monitor, as now we were a bit behind we worked extra hard and got back to where we were and became effective and fast again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I now know how to check if the fuze/Monitor is working so now we don't have to waste time and we can just go straight in.Another major thing that helped us improve is teamwork that we had because if we didn't have teamwork then we would be behind and still be on a lower course, This really helped. To even more improve my learning I can also understand the keyboard more as the keys are very stale and hard to touch it is not a sensitive keyboard so you have to press really hard to get the correct letter.</td>
