    <td>I learnt by switching every 10 minutes so then we can all get a turn but today a group joined us because there monitor isn't working, We then had 3 People in our group so someone was left out because necessarily 2 people is all the job really needs so what was the other person meant to do? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>We all took turns to do the jobs but one person would be left out because we had 3 people in our group during this time this limited our groups learning. I need to work on getting involved when there is a uneven amount of people in our group as it is harder to keep control on who is doing what and what we are meant to do this is also very frustrating because our new partner didn't really want to do much work.</td>

    <td>Next time it will go back to having 2 people and it will go back to normal and it will be easier. Our goal was kind of on track and kind of working as 3's is definitely harder than working in 2â€™s our goal was a kind of achiever because we had to stop in the middle of code but still closer to our goal than further.</td>
